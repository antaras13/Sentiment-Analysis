# About this Project
In this project, I analyzed public sentiment towards the Omicron variant of COVID-19 using data collected from Twitter. The objective was to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral to better understand public perception of the variant.

Key steps included:

Preprocessing the Data: Removed unnecessary elements like URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters to ensure clean data for analysis.
Sentiment Classification: Implemented the TextBlob library to classify the sentiment of each tweet. The polarity score from TextBlob helped categorize the tweets into Positive, Negative, and Neutral sentiment labels.
Data Visualization: A bar plot was generated using Seaborn to visualize the distribution of sentiment labels across the dataset, providing insights into the overall public mood regarding Omicron.
The project demonstrated my ability to handle text data, apply sentiment analysis techniques, and effectively communicate findings through data visualization.
